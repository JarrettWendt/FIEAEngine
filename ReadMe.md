# FIEA Engine

This is a custom game engine that I made from scratch during my graduate course at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy. This is naturally a derivation of an academic library crated by my professor [Dr. Paul Varcholik](https://www.varcholik.org/). I have taken lengths to improve on the original design with modern C++20 features.

## Dependencies
I recommend using `vcpkg` to install the following dependencies:
- `glm`
- `gsl`
- `jsoncpp`
- `ms-gsl`
