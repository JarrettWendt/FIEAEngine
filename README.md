# FIEA Engine

This is a custom game engine that I made from scratch during my graduate course at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy where I studied under [Dr. Paul Varcholik](https://www.varcholik.org/).

The goal of this engine is to incorporate as much modern C++ as possible.

## Dependencies

- [python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/)

### Submodules

- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
- [magic_enum](https://github.com/Neargye/magic_enum)
- [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
- [llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project): Since this engine is so dependant on bleeding edge C++ features, I decided to include a bleeding edge compiler with this repository.
